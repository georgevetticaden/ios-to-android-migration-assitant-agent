## 🟡 In Progress

### 1. Mobile-MCP Integration (0% → Starting)
- **Status**: Ready to implement
- **Next Step**: Fork mobile-next/mobile-mcp
- **Approach**: Natural language commands only
- **Timeline**: 1 hour setup

### 2. Shared-State-MCP Wrapper (0% → Starting)
- **Status**: Ready to implement
- **Next Step**: Create MCP wrapper for existing DuckDB
- **Approach**: Return raw JSON for Claude visualization
- **Timeline**: 1 hour development

### 3. Current Transfer Monitoring
- Transfer ID: TRF-20250820-180056
- Started: 2025-08-20 18:00:56 UTC
- Expected Completion: 2025-08-23 to 2025-08-27
- **Day 3 Status Check**: Due today (August 23, 2025)
- Next Action: Check progress and monitor for completion email

## 🔴 Not Started (But Documented)

### Agent Orchestration Instructions
- **Status**: Requirements complete
- **Location**: agent/instructions.md (to be created)
- **Timeline**: 30 minutes

### Integration Testing
- **Status**: Waiting for components
- **Scope**: All three MCP tools working together
- **Timeline**: 1 hour after components ready

### Demo Recording
- **Status**: Script complete, waiting for implementation
- **Timeline**: After successful integration testing

## Architecture Evolution

### Previous Approach (Considered)
- Custom Python extensions for each app
- Complex credential handling
- Direct database updates from mobile-mcp

### Current Approach (Hybrid Architecture)
- ✅ Natural language commands to mobile-mcp
- ✅ Shared-state-mcp for centralized state
- ✅ Claude orchestrates intelligently
- ✅ No custom code extensions needed

### Why This Change
1. **Maintainability**: UI changes don't break code
2. **Simplicity**: English commands vs Python code
3. **Demo Impact**: Shows AI's natural language capability
4. **Development Speed**: No debugging of custom extensions

## Technical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Keep Photo-Migration As-Is
- **Date**: August 2025
- **Rationale**: Complex 2FA and session handling works perfectly
- **Impact**: Saves weeks of potential debugging

### Decision 2: Natural Language for Mobile
- **Date**: August 2025
- **Rationale**: mobile-mcp already supports it
- **Impact**: Faster implementation, better demo

### Decision 3: Separate State Management
- **Date**: August 2025
- **Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Impact**: Both tools can update state independently

## Performance Metrics

### Photo Migration Tool (Production)
- **Authentication Time**: ~30 seconds (with 2FA)
- **Session Reuse**: < 5 seconds
- **Transfer Initiation**: ~45 seconds
- **Database Operations**: < 100ms

### Expected Mobile-MCP Performance
- **App Installation**: 2-3 minutes
- **Command Response**: < 2 seconds
- **Screenshot Capture**: < 1 second

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✅ Photo migration (already working)
- ✅ State management (simple wrapper)
- ✅ Natural language commands (proven approach)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ Galaxy Fold 7 screenshot dimensions
- ⚠️ ADB connection stability
- ⚠️ WhatsApp UI changes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test screenshot immediately after fork
- Have USB reconnection script ready
- Use flexible natural language descriptions

## Testing Summary
