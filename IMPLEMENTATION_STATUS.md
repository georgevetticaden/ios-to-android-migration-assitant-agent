# Photo Migration MCP Tool - Implementation Status

## 📅 Last Updated: 2025-08-20 (Session 3)

## 🎯 Current Objective
Extend the existing photo-migration MCP tool with 4 new capabilities based on requirements in `requirements/mcp-tools/photo-migration/photo-migration-requirements.md`:
1. `start_transfer` - Initiate iCloud to Google Photos transfer with baseline establishment
2. `check_transfer_progress` - Monitor migration using Google Photos API
3. `verify_transfer_complete` - Final verification with quality checks
4. `check_completion_email` - Gmail integration for Apple completion emails

## ✅ Phase 1: Shared Infrastructure (COMPLETED - Session 2)

### What We Built
Created a **shared infrastructure at root level** that all MCP tools can use:

```
ios-to-android-migration-assistant-agent/
├── shared/                          # ✅ CREATED
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── migration_db.py        # Centralized DuckDB singleton
│   │   └── schemas/
│   │       ├── core_schema.sql    # Core migration tables
│   │       ├── photo_schema.sql   # Photo-specific tables
│   │       ├── whatsapp_schema.sql # Future WhatsApp tables
│   │       └── family_schema.sql  # Future family tables
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── settings.py            # Centralized configuration
│   └── utils/
│       ├── credentials.py         # Google OAuth management
│       └── logging_config.py      # Unified logging
├── scripts/
│   ├── setup_database.py          # Initialize database
│   ├── migration_status.py        # Check migration status
│   └── test_shared_infrastructure.py # Test all components
└── .env.template                   # Environment template
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Shared Database**: Single DuckDB instance at `~/.ios_android_migration/migration.db` for ALL tools
2. **Root-Level Placement**: Infrastructure at root (not under mcp-tools) for broader access
3. **Singleton Pattern**: Database uses singleton to ensure single instance
4. **Master Migration ID**: All tools link to a master migration record

### Database Schema Highlights
- **migration_core**: Master migration tracking, family members, event log, tool coordination
- **photo_migration**: Transfers, progress history, quality samples, email confirmations
- **whatsapp_migration**: (Future) Chat transfers, automation tasks, group mappings
- **family_services**: (Future) Service migrations, email filters, Life360, parental controls

## ✅ Phase 1 Completion Summary (Session 2)

### What Was Completed
1. ✅ Created shared infrastructure at root level
2. ✅ Consolidated .env files to single root `.env`
3. ✅ Updated photo-migration to use root .env
4. ✅ Fixed DuckDB compatibility issues (GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY → SEQUENCES)
5. ✅ Removed cross-schema foreign keys (DuckDB limitation)
6. ✅ Successfully initialized database with all schemas
7. ✅ All tests passing

### Database Successfully Created
- **migration_core**: migrations, family_members, event_log, tool_coordination
- **photo_migration**: transfers, progress_history, quality_samples, email_confirmations, important_photos
- **whatsapp_migration**: chat_transfers, automation_tasks, group_mappings, contact_sync
- **family_services**: service_migrations, email_filters, life360_migration, venmo_teen_accounts, parental_controls, family_calendars

### Test Results
- ✅ `test_shared_infrastructure.py` - All modules loading correctly
- ✅ `test_photo_migration_env.py` - Photo-migration reading from root .env
- ✅ `setup_database.py` - Database created at `~/.ios_android_migration/migration.db`
- ✅ `migration_status.py` - Shows "No active migration" (expected)
- ✅ `mcp-tools/photo-migration/test_client.py` - Still working with refactored config

## 📋 Implementation Plan Overview

### Phase 2: Google Integration - COMPLETED with Pivot (Session 3)

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT PIVOT: Google Photos API Deprecated
During implementation, we discovered that **Google Photos Library API v1 is deprecated (March 31, 2025)** with limited functionality:
- No photo count API available
- "insufficient authentication scopes" errors
- New Google Picker API is read-only (no programmatic access)

#### ✅ Solution: Google Dashboard via Playwright
We successfully pivoted to using **Google Dashboard web scraping** with Playwright:

**What We Built**:
```
mcp-tools/photo-migration/src/photo_migration/
├── google_dashboard_client.py    # ✅ NEW - Playwright automation
│   ├── Session persistence (7-day validity)
│   ├── 2-Step Verification handling
│   ├── Extracts: 42 photos, 162 albums
│   └── Screenshots for verification
├── gmail_monitor.py              # ✅ CREATED - Gmail API integration
│   ├── Search for Apple completion emails
│   ├── OAuth2 authentication
│   └── Email content extraction
└── icloud_client.py              # ✅ EXISTING - Ready for extension
```

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Google Dashboard automation with session persistence
- ✅ Handles 2FA with "Tap Yes on phone" prompt
- ✅ Successfully extracts real photo/album counts
- ✅ Gmail monitor for completion emails
- ✅ No API deprecation concerns - web scraping is stable

### Phase 3: Extend iCloud Client (6-7 hours)
**Modify**: `mcp-tools/photo-migration/src/photo_migration/icloud_client.py`

**Add Methods**:
- `start_transfer(google_email)` - Initiate transfer with baseline
- `check_transfer_progress(transfer_id)` - Monitor progress
- `verify_transfer_complete(transfer_id)` - Final verification
- `check_completion_email(transfer_id)` - Email checking

**Key Changes**:
- Remove credential parameters (use environment only)
- Integrate with shared database
- Add Google API clients
- Browser automation for transfer workflow

### Phase 4: Update MCP Server (2-3 hours)
**Modify**: `mcp-tools/photo-migration/src/photo_migration/server.py`

**Changes**:
- Add 4 new tool definitions
- Remove credential parameters from all tools
- Initialize shared database on startup
- Format responses for Claude Desktop

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (4-5 hours)
- Create comprehensive test suite
- End-to-end transfer testing
- Progress tracking validation
- Email detection testing

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Credential Flow
```
.env (root) → Settings (shared/config) → MCP Tools → APIs
```
- ALL credentials from environment variables
- NEVER passed as parameters from Claude Desktop
- Google OAuth tokens cached with refresh

### Database Flow
```
MCP Tool → MigrationDatabase (singleton) → DuckDB → Persistent State
```
- Single database instance shared across all tools
- Master migration links all tool activities
- Event log provides complete timeline

### Progress Calculation Formula
```
Progress = (Current Google Count - Baseline Count) / Source Total × 100
```
- Baseline established BEFORE transfer starts
- Critical for accurate progress tracking

## ✅ Phase 2 Completion Summary (Session 3)

### What Was Completed
1. ✅ Discovered Google Photos API deprecation issue
2. ✅ Successfully pivoted to Google Dashboard web scraping
3. ✅ Created `google_dashboard_client.py` with session persistence
4. ✅ Implemented 2-Step Verification handling
5. ✅ Created `gmail_monitor.py` for email checking
6. ✅ Updated dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
7. ✅ All tests passing with real data extraction

### Test Results
- ✅ Google Dashboard: Extracts 42 photos, 162 albums
- ✅ Session persistence: No login needed for 7 days
- ✅ 2FA handling: "Tap Yes on phone" fully automated
- ✅ Gmail monitor: OAuth2 authentication working

## 🚀 Next Immediate Steps for Phase 3

### Ready to Begin Phase 3: Extend iCloud Client

1. **Extend icloud_client.py**
   - Import shared database and Google Dashboard client
   - Add `start_transfer(google_email)` method
   - Add `check_transfer_progress(transfer_id)` method
   - Add `verify_transfer_complete(transfer_id)` method
   - Add `check_completion_email(transfer_id)` method

2. **Update server.py**
   - Add 4 new tool definitions
   - Remove credential parameters (use env only)
   - Initialize database on startup

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test full transfer workflow
   - Verify progress tracking
   - Validate email detection

## 📝 Important Notes

### Why Shared Database at Root?
- Future tools (WhatsApp, family-services) need access
- Evaluation scripts can query migration status
- Dashboard/UI components can read state
- Single source of truth for entire migration

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Baseline Accuracy**: Must capture Google Photos count BEFORE transfer
2. **Session Persistence**: Both iCloud (existing) and Google (new)
3. **State Management**: Multi-day tracking via DuckDB
4. **Cross-Tool Coordination**: Tools can check dependencies

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Essential for photo-migration
APPLE_ID=your.email@icloud.com
APPLE_PASSWORD=your_password

# Google Dashboard (Playwright automation)
GOOGLE_EMAIL=your.email@gmail.com
GOOGLE_PASSWORD=your_password

# Gmail API (for completion emails)
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/to/gmail_oauth2_credentials.json

# Session persistence directories
ICLOUD_SESSION_DIR=~/.icloud_session
GOOGLE_SESSION_DIR=~/.google_session
```
