# iOS2Android Migration Agent

## Overview

The iOS2Android Migration Agent is a specialized AI assistant that orchestrates the complete transition from iPhone to Android devices while preserving digital memories and family connections. This agent manages a complex 7-day migration process through natural conversation, making what could be an overwhelming technical challenge feel simple and manageable.

## Core Capabilities

### üì∏ Photo & Video Migration
- Transfers entire iCloud photo libraries (tested with 383GB/60,000+ items)
- Preserves all metadata, albums, and original quality
- Uses Apple's official transfer service for reliability
- Provides daily progress updates with visual indicators

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family Ecosystem Management
- Sets up cross-platform messaging via WhatsApp

## Technical Architecture

The agent orchestrates three MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

1. **web-automation** - Controls browser for iCloud/Google interactions
2. **migration-state** - Manages persistent state in DuckDB
3. **mobile-mcp** - Controls Android device via natural language

## Migration Timeline

**Day 1**: Initialize transfer, set up family apps
**Day 2-3**: Photos processing (not visible yet)
**Day 4**: First photos appear (~28% complete)
**Day 5**: Majority transferred (~57% complete)
**Day 6**: Near completion (~85% complete)
**Day 7**: Verification and celebration (100% complete)

## Key Features
