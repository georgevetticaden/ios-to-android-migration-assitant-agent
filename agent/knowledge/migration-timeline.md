## Important Timeline Notes

### Photo Transfer Expectations
- **Days 1-3**: 0% visible (Apple processing)
- **Day 4**: ~28% appears suddenly
- **Day 5**: ~57% transferred
- **Day 6**: ~85% complete
- **Day 7**: 100% with confirmation

### Why This Timeline?
- Apple's service processes in batches
- Large libraries need significant server time
- Initial processing creates transfer package
- Actual transfer begins around day 3-4
- Accelerates once transfer starts

### Managing User Anxiety
- **Days 1-3**: Reassure that invisible progress is normal
- **Day 4**: Celebrate first appearance enthusiastically
- **Days 5-6**: Show steady progress with visuals
- **Day 7**: Make completion feel momentous

### Contingency Planning
- If no photos by Day 4: Check transfer status via web-automation
- If family resistant: Focus on benefits, not pressure
- If cards delayed: Track via shipping, activate when ready
- If transfer fails: Have manual backup plan ready
