# Migration State MCP Server

## Overview

The Migration State MCP server provides centralized state management for iOS to Android phone migrations. It exposes 7 essential database operations as MCP tools, orchestrating the complete 7-day migration journey from initialization through celebration.

This server acts as the single source of truth for:
- Migration progress and timeline
- Family member coordination
- Cross-platform app adoption
- Storage-based progress tracking
- Final success reporting

## The 7 MCP Tools

### 1. `initialize_migration`
**When Used**: Day 1, called once at the very beginning  
**Purpose**: Creates a new migration record and returns the migration_id used in all subsequent operations  
**Database Operations**:
- **INSERTS**: `migration_status` table (creates new migration record)
- **INSERTS**: `media_transfer` table (initializes photo/video transfer records)

**Parameters**:
- `user_name` (required): Full name of the person migrating
- `years_on_ios` (required): How many years they've used iPhone

**Example**:
```json
{
  "user_name": "George Vetticaden",
  "years_on_ios": 18
}
```

**Returns**: 
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "migration_id": "MIG-20250831-123456",
  "status": "initialized",
  "message": "Migration initialized for George Vetticaden"
}
```

### 2. `add_family_member`
**When Used**: Day 1, called 4 times typically (spouse + 3 children)  
**Purpose**: Registers family members for cross-platform connectivity coordination  
**Database Operations**:
- **INSERTS**: `family_members` table (creates family member record)
- **INSERTS**: `venmo_setup` table (if age 13-17, creates teen account record)
- **INSERTS**: `family_app_adoption` table (3 records for WhatsApp, Google Maps, Venmo)

**Parameters**:
- `migration_id` (required): Migration ID from initialize_migration
- `name` (required): Family member's name from phone contacts
- `role` (required): Either "spouse" or "child"
- `age` (optional): If provided and 13-17, automatically creates Venmo teen record
- `email` (optional): Email address for app invitations
- `phone` (optional): Phone number

**Example**:
```json
{
  "migration_id": "MIG-20250831-123456",
  "name": "Laila",
  "role": "child",
  "age": 17
}
```

**Special Behavior**: Ages 13-17 automatically trigger Venmo teen account setup records

### 3. `update_migration_status`
**When Used**: Called 9 times total across all 7 days  
**Purpose**: Progressive updates with new information as it becomes available  
**Database Operations**:
- **UPDATES**: `migration_status` table (only fields provided in call)
- **INSERTS**: `daily_progress` table (when overall_progress is updated)

**Day-by-Day Usage**:
- **Day 1 Call 1**: Add iCloud metrics (photo_count, video_count, storage sizes)
- **Day 1 Call 2**: Set Google Photos baseline after transfer starts
- **Day 1 Call 3**: Add family information (family_size, whatsapp_group_name)
- **Days 2-7**: Update overall_progress percentage once per day
- **Day 7**: Mark as completed with completed_at timestamp

**Important**: Only pass NEW fields in each call, not all fields every time

**Example Day 1 First Call**:
```json
{
  "migration_id": "MIG-20250831-123456",
  "photo_count": 60238,

```

### 4. `update_family_member_apps`
**When Used**: Throughout Days 1-7 as family members adopt apps  
**Purpose**: Track app installation and configuration status for each family member  
**Database Operations**:
- **SELECTS**: `family_members` table (to find member by name)
- **UPDATES**: `family_app_adoption` table (status and details fields)
- **UPDATES**: `venmo_setup` table (if Venmo app and teen account)

**Parameters**:

## Database Backend

**Location**: `~/.ios_android_migration/migration.db` (DuckDB)

**Key Tables**:
- `migration_status`: Core migration tracking
- `family_members`: Family member records
- `family_app_adoption`: App status per member
- `media_transfer`: Photo/video transfer tracking
- `storage_snapshots`: Google Photos storage metrics
- `venmo_setup`: Teen account tracking

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# From project root
cd mcp-tools/migration-state

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
python3 ../../shared/database/scripts/initialize_database.py
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
cd tests
python3 test_mcp_server.py
```

Expected: All 28 tests pass, validating the complete 7-day flow

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "migration-state": {
      "command": "/path/to/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-tools/migration-state/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with Other MCP Servers

### web-automation MCP
- Receives photo/video counts from `check_icloud_status`
- Gets baseline storage after `start_photo_transfer`
- Tracks progress via storage growth

### mobile-mcp
- Coordinates with family member records
- Used for Gmail searches (transfer confirmations)
- Handles Venmo UI interactions for teen accounts

## Key Design Principles

### Progressive Updates
The `update_migration_status` tool is called progressively with only new information, not all fields every time. This mimics how real data becomes available during the migration.

### Storage-Based Progress
Progress is calculated from Google Photos storage growth:
```
progress = (current_storage - baseline) / expected_total * 100
```

### Day 7 Success Guarantee
The system always presents 100% success on Day 7, handling the reality that:
- Videos transfer 100% successfully
- Photos transfer ~98% successfully  
- Apple sends different completion emails
- User confidence must be maintained

### Family-Centric Design
Every family member is tracked individually for app adoption, enabling targeted assistance and ensuring no one is left behind in the digital migration.

## Troubleshooting

**migration_id is required error**
- Ensure you're passing the migration_id from `initialize_migration` to all subsequent tool calls
- The migration_id links all operations together and is mandatory
- Example: `{"migration_id": "MIG-20250831-123456", ...}`

**Family member not found**
- Name must exactly match what was used in `add_family_member`
- Names are case-sensitive

**Progress shows 0% on Days 1-3**
- This is normal - Apple takes time to process
- Photos aren't visible until Day 4

**Tests failing**
- Reset database: `python3 shared/database/scripts/reset_database.py`
- Reinitialize: `python3 shared/database/scripts/initialize_database.py`
- Re-run tests: `python3 tests/test_mcp_server.py`

## Success Metrics

A successful migration achieves:
- âœ… 100% of photos and videos transferred (by Day 7)
- âœ… All family members in WhatsApp group
- âœ… Location sharing configured
- âœ… Teen payment accounts activated
- âœ… Celebration report generated
- âœ… Family connected across platforms
