## Demo Flow

### 0:00-0:30 - Cold Open: The Unfold Moment

**[SCENE: Close-up of hands holding folded Galaxy]**

**Narrator (on camera):**
"Eighteen years ago, I bought the first iPhone. It changed everything."

**[UNFOLD the Galaxy Z Fold 7 slowly]**

"Today, I'm holding the future again. But switching after 18 years? That's 380GB of photos, a family on iMessage, and two decades of muscle memory."

**[SCENE: Transition to split screen]**

"Watch an AI agent orchestrate this entire migration. No scripts. Real devices. Let's begin."

### 0:30-1:30 - The Problem & Architecture

**[SCENE: Split screen - Claude Desktop + Galaxy]**

**Me:** "Hi Claude. I've been on iPhone for 18 years. I have 380GB of photos, my family of 5 is staying on iPhone, and I just got this Galaxy Z Fold 7. Can you help me migrate everything?"

**Claude:** "I can orchestrate your complete migration from iPhone to Android. I have access to three specialized tools that work together:
- A browser automation tool for iCloud on your Mac
- Direct control of your Galaxy via natural language
- A state management system to track the multi-day process

Let me first check what we're dealing with in your iCloud account..."

**[SCENE: Brief architecture diagram overlay (3 seconds)]**

**Narrator (voiceover):** "Three AI specialists, one orchestrator, zero code."

### 8:00-9:00 - The Galaxy Z Fold 7 Showcase

**[SCENE: Transition to Galaxy full screen]**

**Me:** "Show me why this was all worth it."

**Claude:** "Let me demonstrate your new reality..."

**[PHYSICAL: Pick up actual Galaxy, unfold it dramatically]**

**[Demo multi-window]**
- Google Photos on left
- WhatsApp family chat on right
- Both apps running simultaneously

**[S Pen demonstration]**
- Annotate a migrated photo
- "This is the magic I've been missing"

---

### 9:00-9:30 - Technical Deep Dive

**[SCENE: Back to split screen]**

**Me:** "How did you actually do all this?"

**Claude:** "I orchestrated three specialized AI agents:

1. **Browser Specialist** - Turned iCloud.com into an API using Playwright
2. **Mobile Specialist** - Controlled your Galaxy through natural language
3. **State Manager** - Remembered everything across 5 days

No custom code. No brittle scripts. Just natural language orchestration."

**[SCENE: Architecture diagram overlay - 5 seconds]**

**Claude:** "The key innovation? I speak English to control your phone. When WhatsApp updates their UI, we don't rewrite code‚Äîwe just adjust the conversation."

---

### 9:30-10:00 - The Payoff

**[SCENE: Face to camera]**

**Narrator:** 
"Five days. 380GB. Zero data loss. Family still connected.

This isn't just about switching phones. It's about AI agents that actually DO things, not just talk about them.

The code is open source. The pattern is reproducible. Your migration awaits."

**[SCENE: Split screen showing both devices]**

**Final shot:**
- Claude Desktop showing completion dashboard
- Galaxy Z Fold 7 showing family WhatsApp chat
- Message arrives: "Dad, this actually works better than iMessage!"

6. **Visual Feedback** - See every action on Galaxy
7. **Data Visualization** - React dashboards in Claude
8. **The Payoff** - Family message at the end

### Technical Innovations to Highlight

- **Natural Language** - English commands, not code
- **State Persistence** - AI with long-term memory
- **Parallel Orchestration** - Mac and Android simultaneously
- **The Three Amigos** - How we built this (brief mention)

### Contingency Plans

**If ADB disconnects:**
