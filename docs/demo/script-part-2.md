-The agent asks for card details to start activation.

### 3. Venmo Activation - Laila's Card (1 minute 30 seconds)

-Let's activate Laila's card.

-Watch the phone - agent launches Venmo.

-Navigates to Account settings, selects Laila's teen account.

-Goes to overview and clicks "Activate Laila's Debit Card."

-I provide the expiration and PIN.

-Agent enters these and submits.

-Card activated! But we're not done.

-Agent continues setup - clicks "Invite Laila to complete setup."

### 5. Day 5 Dashboard & Status (1 minute 30 seconds)

-Now the agent checks our overall migration status and creates the Day 5 dashboard.

-Overall migration progress shows 75%.

-But here's the incredible milestone - Family Ecosystem is now 100% complete!

-Let's look at what this 100% family ecosystem means:

-WhatsApp - all 4 family members connected in the Vetticaden Family group.

-Location Sharing - bidirectional sharing complete. Everyone can see each other's locations for peace of mind.

-Scrolling down we see the photo transfer progress.

-We're at 76.3% - over 35,000 photos transferred, nearly 700 videos moved.

-Time to verify with Apple.

### 8. Gmail Verification (45 seconds)
