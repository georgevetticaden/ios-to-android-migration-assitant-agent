# iOS to Android Migration Demo Script - Version 7
**Duration**: 10 minutes (with editing)
**Format**: Split-screen showing Claude Desktop (left) and Galaxy Z Fold 7 (right)

## 0:00-0:30 - OPENING HOOK

### Visual Setup
- **Camera**: Close-up of hands holding Galaxy Z Fold 7
- **Action**: Slowly unfold the phone, revealing the expansive screen

### Narration
**Me (voiceover)**: "In 2007, my girlfriend‚Äînow my wife‚Äîwaited in line at a Chicago Apple Store while I took the Amtrak from St. Louis. When I arrived at Union Station past 10 PM and she handed me that iconic white box, I felt something I hadn't experienced with technology before‚Äîpure awe. The design, the interface, holding the future in my hands.

For 18 years, I upgraded almost every other generation, hoping to recapture that moment. The last five years? Incremental updates. Bigger screens. Same experience. Another thousand dollars.

Three weeks ago, at a Verizon store with my daughter, I picked up this..."

[UNFOLDS the Galaxy Z Fold 7]

"...and there it was again. That same feeling from 2007. Innovation you can literally unfold.

But here's the problem: 18 years in the Apple ecosystem. 383 gigabytes of family photos. A wife and three kids who refuse to leave their iPhones. And me, wanting to switch but needing to stay connected to my Apple-locked family.

So I did what any AI engineer would do‚ÄîI built an agent to orchestrate the entire migration."

## 0:30-1:00 - TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Screen Share
Show architecture diagram with three MCP tools

### Narration
**Me**: "Here's what we built: Claude as the orchestrator, using three MCP tools:
- **photo-migration-mcp**: Turns iCloud's hostile web interface into an API using Playwright
- **mobile-mcp**: Controls my Galaxy through natural language‚Äîno code, just English
- **shared-state-mcp**: DuckDB wrapper for persistent state across our 7-day migration

Let me show you how this actually works..."

## 1:00-1:30 - INITIAL MIGRATION SETUP

### Screen: Claude Interface

### User-Agent Conversation

**Me**: "I just got a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 after 18 years on iPhone. I need to migrate everything from iCloud - especially my almost half of terabyte of  photos going back to 2007. My wife Jaisy and our 3 kids - Laila who's 17, Ethan who's 15, and Maya who's 11 - they're all staying on iPhone. We rely heavily on iMessage, Find My, and Apple Cash. I need to replace these with cross-platform solutions - WhatsApp for messaging, Google Maps location sharing for Find My, and Venmo for payments. Can you help me migrate without disrupting my family?"

**Claude**: "I'll orchestrate your complete migration over 7 days:

**Day 1-5: Photo Migration** - 383GB transfer running in background
**Day 1: Family Connectivity** - WhatsApp, Google Maps, and Venmo setup  
**Day 3: Migration Check-in** - Verify family adoption, address any issues
**Day 4: Photo Progress** - Monitor transfer, test early arrivals
**Day 5: Payment Activation** - Venmo cards and teen accounts
**Day 6: Near Completion** - Final family member onboarding
**Day 7: Validation** - Verify all systems operational

Let's start with your photos. May I access your iCloud to check your photo library?"

**Me**: "Yes, go ahead."

### Tool Execution

```

### Visual
