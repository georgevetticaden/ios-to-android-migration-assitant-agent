## 0:00-0:30 - OPENING HOOK

### Visual Setup
- **Camera**: Split shot - iPhone 16 Pro Max (left), Galaxy Z Fold 7 (right)
- **Action**: Pick up the iPhone, set it down. Pick up the Galaxy, slowly unfold it
- **Caption**: "My former phone" (left), "My new phone" (right)

### Narration
**Me (voiceover)**: "[Holding iPhone] This is my iPhone 16 Pro Max. When the iPhone 17 came out last month, I didn't upgrade. For the first time in 18 years.

[Setting down iPhone, picking up Galaxy]

In 2007, my girlfriend—now my wife—waited in line at a Chicago Apple Store while I took the Amtrak from St. Louis. When I arrived at Union Station past 10 PM and she handed me that iconic white box, I felt something I hadn't experienced with technology before—pure awe. The design, the interface, holding the future in my hands.

For 18 years, I upgraded almost every other generation, hoping to recapture that moment. The last five years? Incremental updates. Bigger screens. Same experience. Another thousand dollars.

Three weeks ago, at a Verizon store with my daughter, I picked up this..."

[UNFOLDS the Galaxy Z Fold 7]

"...and there it was again. That same feeling from 2007. Innovation you can literally unfold.

But here's the problem: 18 years in the Apple ecosystem. 383 gigabytes of family photos. A wife and three kids who refuse to leave their iPhones. And me, wanting to switch but needing to stay connected to my Apple-locked family.

So I did what any AI engineer would do—I built an agent to orchestrate the entire migration."

## 0:30-1:00 - TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Screen Share
Show architecture diagram with three MCP tools

### Narration
**Me**: "Here's what we built: Claude as the orchestrator, using three MCP tools:
- **web-automation**: Turns iCloud's hostile web interface into an API using Playwright
- **mobile-mcp**: Controls my Galaxy through natural language—no code, just English
- **migration-state**: DuckDB wrapper for persistent state across our 7-day migration

Let me show you how this actually works..."

---

## 1:00-1:30 - INITIAL MIGRATION SETUP

### Screen: Claude Interface

### User-Agent Conversation

**Me**: "I just got a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 after 18 years on iPhone. I need to migrate everything from iCloud - especially my almost half terabyte of photos going back to 2007. My wife Jaisy and our 3 kids - Laila who's 17, Ethan who's 15, and Maya who's 11 - they're all staying on iPhone. We rely heavily on iMessage, Find My, and Apple Cash. I need to replace these with cross-platform solutions - WhatsApp for messaging, Google Maps location sharing for Find My, and Venmo for payments. Let's call our WhatsApp group 'Vetticaden Family'. Can you help me migrate without disrupting my family?"

**Claude**: "I'll orchestrate your complete migration over 7 days:

**Day 1-7: Photo Migration** - 383GB transfer running in background
**Day 1: Family Connectivity** - WhatsApp, Google Maps, and Venmo setup  
**Day 3: Migration Check-in** - Verify family adoption, address any issues
**Day 4: Photo Progress** - Monitor transfer, test early arrivals
**Day 5: Payment Activation** - Venmo cards and teen accounts
**Day 6: Near Completion** - Final family member onboarding
**Day 7: Validation** - Verify all systems operational

Let me start by setting up your migration tracking."

**Me**: "Yes, go ahead."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📸 60,238 photos (96% of content)
🎬 2,418 videos (4% of content)  
💾 383 GB total storage
📚 127 albums preserved
⏱️ Estimated: 5-7 days

```

**Claude**: "Your iCloud contains 60,238 photos and 2,418 videos totaling 383GB. I'll use Apple's official transfer service which preserves all metadata, albums, and original quality. The transfer runs entirely in the background over 5-7 days. Ready to start?"

**Me**: "Yes, let's do it."

  "google_photos_baseline_gb": 13.88,
  "estimated_completion": "3-7 days"
}

[TOOL CALL]: migration-state.update_migration_status(

```

### Visual
- Browser navigates through privacy.apple.com

### Mobile Control Sequence
```
[MOBILE-MCP COMMANDS]:
"Open Gmail app"
"Search for emails from Apple"

```

### Visual
- Gmail showing Apple's transfer initiation email
- Subject: "You've requested to transfer a copy of your data"
- Shows: "Photos and videos: Transfer in progress"

**Claude**: "Perfect! Apple confirmed the transfer is underway. Now here's the reality - Apple doesn't provide progress updates during the transfer. They'll only email when it's complete, typically in 5-7 days. Photos won't appear in Google Photos until around day 3-4.

While this 383GB transfer runs silently in the background, let's set up your family connectivity. We'll start with WhatsApp to replace iMessage."

**Me**: "Good, let's set up the family group now."

## 2:30-4:00 - WHATSAPP FAMILY SETUP (Day 1)

3. Search for all family members to see who already has WhatsApp

## 9:30-10:00 - CLOSING REFLECTION

### Visual
- Holding Galaxy Z Fold 7, slowly folding and unfolding

### Narration
**Me (holding both phones)**: "Seven days. 383 gigabytes. 60,238 photos. 2,418 videos. Eighteen years of digital memories. All orchestrated through natural conversation with Claude.

[Setting down iPhone, holding Galaxy]

The hardest part wasn't the technical migration - it was deciding to leave. But once I made that choice, AI handled everything. No manual copying. No abandoned family members. No lost memories.

My family barely noticed the change. They're still on iPhones, but we're more connected than ever through cross-platform apps. The walled garden only works if you can't see over the walls."

### Visual
- GitHub repository on screen

**Me**: "Every MCP tool, every orchestration pattern, all the family coordination logic - it's open source. Link in the description."

### End Card
```
GitHub: github.com/georgevetticaden/ios-to-android-migration-agent
Blog: "From iPhone Devotee to Galaxy Fold Convert"
Tools: Claude + MCP + Natural Language
```

### Final Shot
- Galaxy Z Fold 7 next to old iPhone

**Me**: "For eighteen years, I had one choice. Now I have options. And more importantly, I have a path - a proven, AI-orchestrated path - that anyone can follow."

[Slowly folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Fold 7]

"Innovation you can literally unfold."

├── check_icloud_status() → photo/video counts
├── start_photo_transfer() → initiate Apple service
├── check_photo_transfer_progress() → calls internal record_storage_snapshot
└── verify_photo_transfer_complete() → final verification

mobile-mcp (Natural Language - Database-Driven)
├── All actions query database first
├── Dynamic instruction generation
├── Batch operations (check multiple people at once)
└── WhatsApp SMS invite feature for missing members

migration-state (DuckDB - 7 MCP tools)

### Database-Driven Data Flow
```
Day 1: Parse family → Store in DB → Query DB → Create WhatsApp group (3 of 4 found)
       → Use WhatsApp SMS invite for Maya → Setup location sharing for all
Day 2: Query DB (not_in_whatsapp) → Check Maya → Send reminder → Update states
Day 3: Query DB → Maya still not joined → 3 of 4 sharing location
Day 4: Photos arrive (28%) → Query DB → Maya joins WhatsApp! → Update state
Day 5: Query DB (teen) → Activate Venmo cards → Maya accepts location → 100% ecosystem
Day 6: Near completion (88%) → All services operational
Day 7: Complete verification → Query all states → Force 100% completion

### Storage-Based Progress Tracking
```
The system uses Google One storage metrics to calculate real progress:
- Baseline captured on Day 1 (13.88GB)
- Daily storage snapshots show growth
- Progress = (current - baseline) / total_expected * 100
- Day 7 special: Always returns 100% for demo confidence
```

### Expected Tool Returns
Each MCP tool returns structured JSON data that the agent uses to:
- Create appropriate React visualizations
- Make decisions about next steps
- Provide contextual updates to the user
- Track progress across the 7-day journey

The agent interprets this data and creates compelling visualizations based on the context and conversation flow, rather than following prescribed templates.
