# iOS to Android Migration Agent Demo
## Video Script - Intro & Day 1 (Complete Updated Version)

### 1. Intro (35 seconds)

-On the left, my iPhone 16 Pro Max. On the right, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.

-For 18 years, I've been all-in on iPhone. Every flagship. Every service. My entire family.

-Three weeks ago, I picked up this Galaxy Fold at a Verizon store.

-And then... [UNFOLD HAPPENS] ...there it was. 

-The future, unfolding in my hands.

-And I knew right then, it was time to make the switch.

-Next week, when the iPhone 17 launches, for the first time ever, I won't be upgrading.

-[AS IPHONE MOVES OUT OF FRAME, GALAXY CENTERS]

-But nearly two decades in Apple's ecosystem means half a terabyte of memories locked in iCloud.

-Plus the invisible chains - iMessage groups, Find My locations, Apple Cash allowances.

-Apple counts on this inertia to keep you trapped.

-So I built an AI agent to orchestrate the entire escape.

-Let me show you how it works.

### 2. Technical Architecture (30 seconds)

*[Transition: Split screen - you stay on left, right side shows build-out animation]*

-Here's what powers this migration - a complete AI orchestration stack.

-First, Claude Desktop running the iOS2Android Agent with Claude Opus 4 for intelligence.

-Next, three custom MCP servers:

-Web-automation server I built to turn Apple's hostile transfer service into an API

-Migration-state server I created to track the entire 7-day orchestration journey in DuckDB

-Mobile-MCP server I forked from GitHub and optimized for the Galaxy Fold 7

-These MCP servers let the agent automate complex workflows across both devices - browser automation on my laptop and direct control of my Android phone.

-Everything runs locally, credentials never touch the LLM, and the agent orchestrates it all through natural conversation.

-Let's see it in action.

### 3. The iOS2Android Migration Agent (45 seconds)

-This is the iOS2Android Migration Agent running in Claude Desktop.
-It's not just a file transfer tool - it orchestrates Apple's official photo service, rebuilds family connectivity, and tracks everything over 7 days.
-Here's what makes this special:
-First, it uses MCP browser automation to navigate Apple's hidden transfer service
-Second, it controls your Android phone to set up WhatsApp, Google Maps, and Venmo
-Third, it creates these React dashboards showing real-time progress
-And most importantly - it handles the reality that Apple takes 7 days to process your photos.
-Let's start the migration.

### 4. Demo Setup (30 seconds)

*[Transition: Demo setup takes majority of screen, you in small window bottom right]*

-Let me show you the demo setup.
-On the left is our iOS2Android Agent running in Claude Desktop.
-On the right, top - that's my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 mirrored so you can see everything happening on the phone.
-Right side, bottom - a Chrome browser that will interact with Apple's iCloud services.
-The agent will control both devices throughout the demo, automating the entire migration.
-Let's start.

### 5. Agent Walkthrough (45 seconds)

-Quick look at the iOS2Android Agent features.

-First, the agent instructions - I'll just touch on the mission statement. [Open instructions]
-The agent orchestrates complete iOS to Android transitions through natural conversation over 7 days.

-Now the tools. [Open tools panel]
-Three custom MCP servers: web-automation, mobile-mcp-local, migration-state.

-Let me show each server's tools. [Click through each]

-Web-automation has tools to connect to Apple's transfer service, check your photo library, and initiate the migration.

-Mobile-mcp-local controls the Galaxy Fold through natural language - opening apps, creating groups, sending messages.

-Migration-state tracks the entire 7-day journey, family members, and progress in a database.

-That's the technical foundation. Now let's see it work.

### 6. First Interaction - What Can You Do? (30 seconds)

-I'll ask the agent what it can do.

-[Agent responds with comprehensive capabilities]

-Look at this response - it's already strategizing the complete migration.

-7-day orchestration timeline, cross-platform family solutions, tool coordination.

-The agent understands this isn't just a technical task - it's preserving 18 years of digital life.

-Let's start the actual migration.

### 7. Initialize the Migration (1 minute)

-I provide my complete migration scenario - 18 years on iPhone, switching to Galaxy Z Fold 7, family of five all embedded in Apple's ecosystem.

-I include all the details - my wife Jaisy, our three kids with their ages, the massive photo library, the cross-platform challenges.

-[Agent immediately processes everything]

-Perfect! The agent strategizes the entire migration plan.

-It's registered all family members - marking Laila and Ethan as Venmo Teen eligible based on their ages.

-Migration ID generated: MIG-20250903-102718.

-Look at the 7-day timeline it's created - today's tasks include checking iCloud, initiating transfer, setting up WhatsApp, Google Maps location sharing, and ordering Venmo cards.

-The agent has everything mapped out based on how Apple's service actually works.

### 8. Check iCloud Photo Library (45 seconds)

-First task - assess what we're migrating.

-Watch the browser on the right - the agent is connecting to privacy.apple.com.

-This is Apple's Copy Transfer Service for photos and videos - most people don't even know it exists.

-Real Apple ID login, real two-factor authentication - but credentials never touch the LLM, they're handled securely by the web-automation tools.

-The agent navigates through Apple's transfer service and extracts the data.

-Look - the agent creates this iCloud Dashboard showing the magnitude of what we're moving.

-More than 60,000 photos and 2,400 videos spanning 18 years - half a terabyte of family memories.

-We're ready to start the transfer.

### 9. Start the Photo Transfer (1 minute)

-Let's tell the agent to start the transfer.

-Watch the browser - agent navigating Apple's multi-step process.

-Now here's interesting - Apple requires OAuth2 authentication to Google.

-See the consent popup appearing on the Galaxy Fold above? The agent controls the phone and accepts it.

-With consent granted, Apple's transfer service resumes - confirming photos and videos to be transferred.

-Transfer initiated! Now the agent verifies this worked.

-Watch the phone - agent opens Gmail and searches for Apple's confirmation email.

-There it is - "We'll start copying your photos to Google Photos."

-But here's the reality - nothing visible for 3-4 days, and Apple shows no progress until complete.

-The agent solves this by capturing our Google Photos baseline before the transfer starts.

-That's how we'll track real progress when photos start appearing on Day 4.

-The agent knows this timeline and sets proper expectations.

### 10. Set Up WhatsApp Family Group (1 minute)

-While photos process in the background, we rebuild family connectivity.

-First - WhatsApp to replace iMessage.

-Watch the phone - agent launching WhatsApp and starting the automation to create the Vetticaden Family group.

-Searching contacts...

-Jaisy - found and added!

-Laila - found and added!

-Ethan - found and added!

-The agent detects the youngest, Maya, doesn't have WhatsApp installed.

-Creates the group without her - WhatsApp group created.

-Now the agent uses "Invite to WhatsApp" feature which opens Messages.

-See the personalized invitation it sends to Maya.

-Perfect! The agent generates this dashboard showing WhatsApp fully configured - 3 of 4 family members in the group, with Maya's SMS invitation sent and pending install.

-Cross-platform messaging successfully configured.

### 11. Google Maps Location Sharing (45 seconds)

-Next - Google Maps location sharing to replace Apple's Find My.

-Agent launches Maps on the phone.

-I need to share my location with all four family members and request they share theirs with me.

-Watch - for each family member, I'm sharing my real-time location until I turn it off.

-Starting with Jaisy - share location, then request she shares back.

-Same for Laila, Ethan, and Maya.

-See the location sharing screen - all four family members listed.

-I'm now sharing my location with everyone.

-The agent will track which members share their locations back over the coming days.

-Critical for family safety across platforms.

### 12. Venmo Teen Cards (30 seconds)

-Final family service - Venmo Teen cards to replace Apple Cash.

-The agent identifies Laila and Ethan are eligible for teen accounts.

-I've already ordered their cards - they'll arrive in a few days.

-Agent tracks this for Day 5 when we'll activate them.

-All family services now in progress.

### 13. Day 1 Complete Dashboard (30 seconds)

-Let's see our Day 1 summary.

-The agent creates this beautiful React dashboard showing Day 1 complete - 35% overall migration progress with photo transfer initiated, family apps in progress, and Venmo cards ordered.

-Scrolling down reveals the 7-day migration timeline - each day building toward 100% success.

-The agent tracks everything with our migration ID - we'll use this to check status in the coming days.

-Day 1 complete. Let's fast forward to Day 5 to see the migration progress unfold.
