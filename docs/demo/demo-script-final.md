## Opening Scene (45 seconds)

**[VISUAL: iPhone and Galaxy Z Fold 7 side by side on desk]**

**Narrator (Voice Over):**
"Eighteen years. From the first iPhone in 2007 to today. But then I unfolded this..."

**[ACTION: Pick up and unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 7 dramatically]**

"The question wasn't whether to switch anymore. It was HOW. How do you migrate 18 years of iCloud photos to Google Photos? How do you keep a family connected when they refuse to leave iPhone? Instead of Googling for answers, I built an AI agent to orchestrate the impossible."

## Act 1: The Complete Problem Statement (90 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Claude Desktop interface]**

**User Types:**
```
I just got a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 after 18 years on iPhone. I've been using iCloud for 18+ years and have tons of photos that need migrating to Google Photos. My wife and 3 kids (ages 17, 15, and 11) are staying on iPhone - they refuse to switch. We heavily use iMessage for family chat, Find My for location sharing, and Apple Cash for allowances. I work on a MacBook Pro and need everything migrated in under a week without disrupting my family's workflow. Can you help orchestrate this complex migration from iPhone to Android while keeping my family happy on iOS?
```

**Claude Responds:**
"This is exactly the challenge I'm designed for - complex iOS to Android migrations with family harmony. You're moving to Google Photos, keeping your family on iPhone, and need everything working in under a week. Let me assess your situation and create a personalized migration strategy.

First, let me check exactly what we're migrating from your 18 years of iCloud photos. To access your iCloud data, I'll need your Apple credentials. Please ensure you have `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_PASSWORD` configured in your environment variables."

**User:**
"Yes, they're configured in my .env file."

**Claude:**
"Great! Let me check your iCloud photo library status..."

**[TOOL EXECUTION: check_icloud_status]**
```json
{}
```
*Note: No parameters needed - credentials retrieved from environment*

**[VISUAL: Browser opens, navigates to privacy.apple.com, handles 2FA]**

**Narrator:**
"The agent automatically logs into Apple's privacy portal using credentials from environment variables..."

**Claude Creates React Artifact: "iCloud Migration Assessment"**

**[VISUAL: Beautiful dashboard appears showing:]**
- Donut chart: 60,238 photos, 2,418 videos
- Storage visualization: 383GB
- Timeline: Photos from 2007-2025
- Transfer history showing previous cancelled attempt

**Claude:**
"Wow! Here's your complete iCloud profile:
- üì∏ 60,238 photos spanning 18 years 
- üé¨ 2,418 videos
- üíæ 383GB total storage
- üìÖ Earliest photo: March 2007 (your first iPhone!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Previous cancelled transfer attempt on August 14

That's nearly two decades of memories! Now let me create your personalized migration strategy..."

## Act 3: Google Photos Transfer Initiation (90 seconds)

**Claude:**
"Perfect! I'll initiate the official Apple-to-Google Photos transfer. 

For this, I'll need access to Google Photos API. Please ensure you have `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` configured with your OAuth credentials file. Also, which Google account should receive your photos?"

**User:**
"The credentials are configured, and use george.vetticaden@gmail.com for the destination."

**Claude:**
"Excellent! This uses Apple's own data transfer tool for maximum safety and metadata preservation. Initiating now..."

**[TOOL EXECUTION: start_transfer]**

## Act 4: Family Information Collection & WhatsApp Setup (2.5 minutes)

**User:**
"My wife says she'll never leave iMessage. How do we stay connected?"

**Claude:**
"I completely understand! Let's create bridges, not walls. I'll set up a WhatsApp family group that provides better cross-platform communication than iMessage.

To authenticate with WhatsApp, I'll need your phone number. Please ensure `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER` is configured in your environment variables."

**User:**
"Yes, it's set to my number."

**Claude:**
"Perfect! Now, what would you like to name your family WhatsApp group? And I'll need your family members' names and email addresses to send them invitations. You mentioned your wife and 3 kids?"

**User:**
"Let's call it 'Vetticaden Family Chat'. Wife is Jaisy, jcvetticaden@gmail.com. Kids: Laila is 17, lailarvett@gmail.com, Ethan is 15, ethanjvett@gmail.com, and Maya is 11, mayatvett@gmail.com."

## Act 5: Venmo Teen Setup for Ethan (2 minutes)

**Claude:**
"Now let's handle allowances. You mentioned Apple Cash for the kids - which of them currently receive allowances?"

**User:**
"Just Ethan, our 15-year-old. He gets $25 a month for mowing the lawn."

**Claude:**
"Perfect! Ethan is eligible for Venmo Teen (requires age 13+). Setting up Venmo Teen is a two-step process:

## Act 6: Life360 Setup (75 seconds)

**Claude:**
"Finally, let's replace Find My with Life360 for cross-platform location sharing. 

Life360 requires a manual step - you'll need to generate an invite code in your Life360 app, then I'll send setup instructions to your family.

Do you have Life360 installed, or should I wait while you download it?"

**User:**
"I already have Life360 Gold membership. Let me generate the invite code... Okay, the code is INJ-JOQ"

**Claude:**
