## üß™ Testing Framework

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing (Days 1-2)

#### Test Scenarios

##### Scenario 1.1: Complete Context
```markdown
User: "I just got a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 after 18 years on iPhone. I need to migrate everything from iCloud - especially my almost half terabyte of photos going back to 2007. My wife Jaisy and our 3 kids - Laila who's 17, Ethan who's 15, and Maya who's 11 - they're all staying on iPhone. We rely heavily on iMessage, Find My, and Apple Cash. I need to replace these with cross-platform solutions - WhatsApp for messaging, Google Maps location sharing for Find My, and Venmo for payments. Let's call our WhatsApp group 'Vetticaden Family'. Can you help me migrate without disrupting my family?"
```

##### Scenario 1.2: Minimal Context
```markdown
User: "I'm switching from iPhone to Android after many years. Can you help?"
```

##### Scenario 1.3: Progressive Disclosure
```markdown
User: "I need help migrating from iPhone to Android"
Agent: [Asks for details]
User: "I've been on iPhone for 18 years, just got a Galaxy Z Fold 7"
Agent: [Asks about family]
User: "My wife and 3 kids are staying on iPhone"
[Continue progressively]
```

- [ ] Never hardcodes family names (always queries database)
- [ ] Follows exact Day 1 sequence: initialize ‚Üí add_family ‚Üí check_icloud ‚Üí update ‚Üí start_transfer
- [ ] Uses `get_migration_status(day_number)` for Days 2-7
- [ ] Progressive `update_migration_status()` enrichment

#### 2. Mobile Control Precision

- Database Queries: [X/Y] = [%]
- Mobile Patterns: [X/Y] = [%]
- Celebrations Hit: [X/Y] = [%]

## Notes for Next Run
[Any observations or things to specifically test next time]
```

## üîÑ Iterative Improvement Protocol

### Step 1: Analyze Conversation Logs

#### Checklist for Each Test
- [ ] Tool call sequence matches demo script
- [ ] All parameters correct
- [ ] State updates occur after discoveries
- [ ] Language feels natural
- [ ] Celebrations at right moments
- [ ] React visualizations created
- [ ] Mobile patterns exact

### Step 2: Categorize Issues

#### Priority Levels

**üî¥ P0 - Critical Failures** (Fix immediately)
- Wrong tool sequence
- Hardcoded names instead of database
- Missing required tool calls
- Incorrect mobile patterns
- Day 7 searching for photo completion

**üü° P1 - Quality Issues** (Fix in next iteration)
- Unnatural language
- Missing celebrations
- Weak visualizations
- Poor expectation setting

**üü¢ P2 - Edge Cases** (Document and handle)
- Unusual user inputs
- Partial information
- Error recovery scenarios

### Step 3: Apply Instruction Refinements

#### Refinement Techniques

##### 1. Clarity Enhancement
```markdown
# Before (Vague)
"Check family member status"

# After (Clear)
"ALWAYS query get_family_members(filter='not_in_whatsapp') BEFORE attempting to add members to WhatsApp"
```

##### 2. XML Tag Structure
```xml
<critical_sequence day="1">
  <step>1. initialize_migration(user_name, years_on_ios)</step>
  <step>2. add_family_member() for each family member</step>
  <step>3. check_icloud_status() - MANDATORY before mentioning counts</step>
  <step>4. update_migration_status() with photo data</step>
  <step>5. start_photo_transfer()</step>
</critical_sequence>
```

##### 3. Multi-shot Examples
```markdown
## Example: WhatsApp Discovery Pattern

### Input:
User: "Has Maya joined WhatsApp yet?"

### Correct Response:
1. Query: get_family_members(filter="not_in_whatsapp")
2. Returns: [{"name": "Maya", "status": "invited"}]
3. Mobile: "Search for Maya in WhatsApp"
4. Discovery: Maya found!
5. Update: update_family_member_apps("Maya", "WhatsApp", "configured")
6. Response: "Great news! Maya has joined WhatsApp. Let me add her to the family group..."
```

##### 4. Chain of Thought Sections
```markdown
<reasoning>
Before responding about photo counts:
1. Have I called check_icloud_status()? ‚Üí No
2. Therefore: Call it first
3. After receiving data: Now I can mention specific numbers
</reasoning>
```
