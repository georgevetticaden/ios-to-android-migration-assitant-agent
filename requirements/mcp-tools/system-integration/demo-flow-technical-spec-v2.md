## Day 1: Setup and Initialization

### 0:00-1:00 - Opening and Initial Check

#### User-Agent Conversation
**User**: "I just got a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 after 18 years on iPhone. I have tons of photos in iCloud that need migrating to Google Photos. My wife Jaisy and our 3 kids - Laila, Ethan, and Maya - are staying on iPhone. We use iMessage for family chat, Find My for location sharing, and Apple Cash for allowances. I need everything migrated in under a week without disrupting my family. Can you help orchestrate this?"

**Claude**: "I'll create a 7-day migration plan to move your photos to Google and set up cross-platform apps for your family. Let me first check your iCloud to analyze your photo library."

## Natural Language Command Patterns

### Successful Patterns
- "Open [App Name]"
- "Tap the [color] button"
- "Search for [name]"
- "Type '[text]'"
- "Select '[option]'"
- "Scroll down"
- "Take screenshot"

### Avoid These Patterns
- Coordinate-based tapping
- Element IDs or class names
- Complex XPath selectors
- Platform-specific APIs

---

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Common Issues and Solutions

**WhatsApp contact not found**:
- Send email invitation
- Check back on Day 3
- Retry search with variations

**Photos not appearing**:
- Expected until Day 4
- Check Apple transfer status
- Verify Google account

**Venmo cards delayed**:
- Normal variation (3-7 days)
- Continue other tasks
- Check daily for arrival

**Family member doesn't respond**:
- Send reminder email
- Continue with others
- Update status as "pending"
