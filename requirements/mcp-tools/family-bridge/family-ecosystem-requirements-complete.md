# Family Ecosystem Migration Requirements - Natural Language Orchestration

## Executive Summary

This document defines requirements for migrating a family of 5 from iOS to a mixed iOS/Android ecosystem, where the primary user switches to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 while family members remain on iPhone. The solution leverages Claude's natural language orchestration capabilities with mobile-mcp for direct device control.

## Business Context

### Current State
- **Primary User**: On iPhone 16 Pro Max for 18 years
- **Family Members**: Wife (Jaisy) + 3 kids (Laila 17, Ethan 15, Maya 11) 
- **Ecosystem Lock-in**: iMessage, Find My, Apple Cash, iCloud Family Sharing
- **Pain Points**: No cross-platform compatibility, forcing Android user isolation

### Target State  
- **Primary User**: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7
- **Family Members**: Remaining on iPhones
- **Solution**: Cross-platform services that work seamlessly
- **Timeline**: Setup within 1 day, full migration within 7 days

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Zero family communication disruption
- ✅ Location sharing functional for all members
- ✅ Teen payment systems operational
- ✅ Photo sharing maintained
- ✅ < 30 minutes active setup time
- ✅ Natural language automation (no code)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Principle: Natural Language Orchestration
All Android automation is achieved through natural language commands to mobile-mcp. Claude orchestrates by issuing English commands like "Open WhatsApp" or "Click the blue Continue button." No custom code extensions required.

### Tool Architecture
```
Claude (Orchestrator)
    ├── photo-migration-mcp [Mac] - iCloud.com automation
    ├── mobile-mcp [Galaxy] - Android control via natural language  
    └── shared-state-mcp [Shared] - DuckDB state management
```

### State Management Flow
1. Claude executes mobile-mcp commands (natural language)
2. Claude verifies completion visually
3. Claude updates shared-state-mcp with results
4. State persists across sessions for multi-day migration

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: WhatsApp Family Bridge

#### User Story
As a parent switching to Android, I need my iOS family to message me seamlessly without them changing apps or behaviors.

3. "Look for WhatsApp Messenger by WhatsApp LLC"
4. "Click the Install button"
5. "Wait for installation to complete"

# Setup Phase
6. "Open WhatsApp from app drawer"
7. "Click Agree and Continue on the welcome screen"
8. "Enter phone number 630-555-0100 in the phone field"
9. "Click the Next button"
10. "Wait for SMS verification"
11. "Enter the 6-digit code when it arrives"

# Group Creation Phase
12. "Click the new chat floating button at bottom right"
13. "Select New Group from the menu"
14. "Search for Jaisy in the search box"
15. "Check the checkbox next to Jaisy"
16. "Search for Laila"
17. "Check the checkbox next to Laila"
18. "Search for Ethan"
19. "Check the checkbox next to Ethan"
20. "Search for Maya"
21. "Check the checkbox next to Maya"
22. "Click the green forward arrow"
23. "Type 'Vetticaden Family' as the group name"
24. "Click the green Create button"

# Verification Phase
25. "Type 'Hello family! This is dad on Android now!'"
26. "Click send"
27. "Take screenshot of the created group"
```

#### State Management Updates
```python
# After successful WhatsApp setup
shared-state-mcp.update_app_status(
    migration_id="MIG-2024-001",
    app_name="whatsapp",
    status="completed",
    details={
        "group_name": "Vetticaden Family",
        "members_added": 4,
        "installation_time": "2min 15sec"
    }
)

# Update each family member
for member in ["Jaisy", "Laila", "Ethan", "Maya"]:
    shared-state-mcp.update_family_member_status(
        migration_id="MIG-2024-001",
        member_name=member,
        service="whatsapp",
        status="joined"
    )
```

#### Error Recovery
- **If Play Store requires sign-in**: "Sign in with Google account first"
- **If contacts not found**: "Manually add phone numbers instead"
- **If verification fails**: "Request new SMS code"
- **If group creation fails**: "Start over with new group"

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Natural Language Robustness
- **Requirement**: Commands must work with reasonable variations
- **Examples**: 
  - "Click Install" = "Tap Install button" = "Press Install"
  - "Open WhatsApp" = "Launch WhatsApp" = "Start WhatsApp"
- **Error Handling**: Retry with rephrased command if first fails
- **Specificity**: Use detailed descriptions when multiple elements exist

### NFR2: State Persistence
- **Requirement**: Migration state survives interruptions
- **Implementation**: DuckDB with WAL mode
- **Backup**: Hourly snapshots
- **Recovery**: Resume from any point

### NFR3: Privacy & Security
- **No Password Storage**: Credentials never in logs or state
- **Redaction**: Phone numbers partially hidden in responses
- **Screenshot Review**: Check for sensitive data before sharing
- **Manual Entry**: User enters passwords/codes directly

### NFR4: Performance Targets
- **App Installation**: < 2 minutes per app
- **Group Creation**: < 3 minutes
- **Location Setup**: < 5 minutes for all members
- **State Updates**: < 100ms
- **Screenshot Capture**: < 1 second

### NFR5: User Experience
- **Clear Feedback**: Every action confirmed visually
- **Progress Indication**: User knows what's happening
- **Error Messages**: Actionable guidance when things fail
- **Manual Fallback**: Instructions if automation fails

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
```python
# Integration test example
async def test_whatsapp_family_setup():
    """Test complete WhatsApp family setup flow"""
    # Initialize migration
    migration_id = await shared_state.initialize_migration(
        user_id="test_user",
        family_members=[...]
    )
    
    # Execute WhatsApp setup
    result = await claude.orchestrate_whatsapp_setup(migration_id)
    
    # Verify state updates
    status = await shared_state.get_migration_status(migration_id)
    assert status["apps"]["whatsapp"] == "completed"
    assert status["family_members_connected"] == 4
```
