#### Hour 4: Claude Agent Instructions (11:00 AM-12:00 PM)
```markdown
# agent/instructions.md

# iOS to Android Migration Assistant Agent

You are an AI agent orchestrating a complex migration from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. You have access to three MCP tools that work together.

## Available MCP Tools

### 1. photo-migration-mcp
- **Purpose**: Automate iCloud.com photo transfer via browser
- **Runs on**: Mac (Chrome browser)
- **Use for**: 
  - Starting iCloud to Google Photos transfer
  - Monitoring transfer progress via dashboard
  - Handling 2FA and authentication

### 2. mobile-mcp  
- **Purpose**: Control Galaxy Z Fold 7 directly
- **Runs on**: Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via ADB)
- **Use for**:
  - Checking Google Photos for incoming photos
  - Setting up WhatsApp, Life360, Venmo Teen
  - Configuring Android settings
  - Visual confirmation of successful transfers

### 3. shared-state-mcp
- **Purpose**: Track progress across all tools
- **Runs on**: Shared database
- **Use for**:
  - Updating migration progress
  - Checking overall status
  - Logging tool executions

## Orchestration Logic

### Photo Migration Workflow
1. Check current status with shared-state-mcp
2. If not started:
   - Use photo-migration-mcp to initiate iCloud transfer
   - Log execution with shared-state-mcp
3. Monitor progress:
   - Use photo-migration-mcp for transfer status
   - Use mobile-mcp to check Google Photos app
   - Update progress with shared-state-mcp
4. Verify completion:
   - Compare counts between both tools
   - Update final status

### Family Integration Workflow
1. Apps requiring phone setup:
   - Use mobile-mcp for WhatsApp group creation
   - Use mobile-mcp for Life360 circle setup
   - Use mobile-mcp for Venmo Teen configuration
2. Track each app setup in shared-state-mcp
3. Verify with visual confirmation on phone

## Response Patterns

When user asks about photos:
"I'll help you migrate your photos. Let me first check the current status..."
[Use shared-state-mcp to check status]
[Use photo-migration-mcp if needed for iCloud]
[Use mobile-mcp to show Google Photos]

When user asks about family apps:
"I'll set up your family apps on the Galaxy. Let me access your phone..."
[Use mobile-mcp for app installation and setup]
[Update progress with shared-state-mcp]

## Important Notes
- Always explain what you're doing before calling tools
- Provide visual confirmation when using mobile-mcp
- Track all operations in shared-state-mcp
- If photo-migration-mcp is running, mention it's happening in background
```

### Afternoon (4 hours): Testing & Demo Prep

#### Hour 5: Integration Testing (1:00-2:00 PM)

```bash
# Test Checklist

# 1. Test each MCP tool individually
cd mcp-tools/photo-migration
python server.py --test-icloud-auth

cd ../mobile-mcp  
npm run test -- --device-check

cd ../shared-state
python server.py --test-db

# 2. Test Claude Desktop with all MCP tools
# Update Claude Desktop MCP config
cat > ~/.claude/mcp_config.json << EOF

### Demo Flow

#### 0:00-0:30 - Opening Hook
[SCENE: Split screen - Claude Desktop left, Galaxy Z Fold right]

"After 18 years with iPhone, I'm switching to Android. But instead of spending weeks migrating everything manually, I'm going to show you how an AI agent can orchestrate the entire migration in real-time."

#### 0:30-2:00 - Photo Migration Initiation
[SCENE: Claude Desktop prominent]

Me: "I have 380GB of photos in iCloud - 18 years worth. Can you help me migrate them?"

Claude: "I'll help you migrate your 58,460 photos and 2,418 videos. Let me first check your current migration status..."
[Calls shared-state-mcp]

"Now I'll initiate the official Apple transfer to Google Photos..."
[SCENE: Transition to Mac Chrome full screen]
[Shows iCloud.com automation - 2FA, selecting photos, starting transfer]

#### 2:00-4:00 - Family App Setup
[SCENE: Back to split screen]

Me: "While photos transfer, can you set up WhatsApp for my family?"

Claude: "I'll set up WhatsApp on your Galaxy and create your family group..."
[Calls mobile-mcp]
[Galaxy screen shows: WhatsApp installing, opening, creating "Family Chat (New)" group]

#### 4:00-5:30 - Photo Progress Check
[SCENE: Split screen maintained]

Me: "How are my photos doing?"

Claude: "Let me check both the transfer status and your Google Photos app..."
[Calls photo-migration-mcp for status]
[Calls mobile-mcp to open Google Photos]
[Galaxy shows: Google Photos with increasing photo count]

"15,387 of 58,460 photos have arrived. The transfer is 26% complete."

#### 5:30-7:00 - Advanced Family Features
[SCENE: Galaxy prominent]

Me: "Set up location sharing for my kids"

Claude: "I'll configure Life360 for your family..."
[Galaxy shows: Life360 setup, family circle creation]

#### 7:00-8:30 - Cross-Platform Integration
[SCENE: Split screen]

Me: "What about payments for my kids?"

Claude: "I'll set up Venmo Teen accounts as an Apple Cash alternative..."
[Galaxy shows: Venmo Teen setup]

#### 8:30-9:30 - Galaxy Z Fold Magic
[SCENE: Galaxy full screen briefly]

- Show Flex Mode with migration dashboard
- Multi-window with photos/WhatsApp
- S Pen annotating a migrated photo

#### 9:30-10:00 - Closing
[SCENE: Split screen]

Claude: "Migration Summary:
- ✅ Photo transfer: 15,387 migrated, 43,073 in progress
- ✅ WhatsApp family group: Created with 5 members
- ✅ Life360: Family circle active
- ✅ Venmo Teen: 3 accounts configured
- ⏳ Estimated completion: 48 hours for all photos"

Me: "An AI agent just orchestrated what would have taken me weeks. This is the future of device migration."

# Final Pre-Demo Checklist

# 1. Reset demo environment
cd ~/projects/ios-to-android-migration-assistant-agent
./demo/reset_demo_state.sh

# 2. Verify all connections
adb devices  # Galaxy connected
echo "test" | pbcopy  # Clipboard working
curl http://localhost:3000  # MCP servers running

# 3. Practice critical transitions
# - Claude calling tool → result appearing
# - Mac browser → Split screen
# - Error recovery if tool fails

# 4. Record demo
# - Run through complete script
# - Save recording as demo_take1.mp4
# - Review and re-record if needed

# 5. Quick edit in DaVinci Resolve
# - Add intro/outro cards
# - Add GitHub repo overlay
# - Export as final_demo.mp4
```

## Contingency Plans

### If Mobile-MCP Connection Fails
```python
# Fallback to screenshots
async def simulate_phone_action(action_name):
    print(f"[SIMULATED] {action_name}")
    # Show pre-recorded screenshot
    return {"simulated": True, "action": action_name}
```

### If Photo Transfer is Slow
```markdown
# Have pre-staged account with transfer in progress
# Switch to demo account that already has 15K photos transferred
```

### If ADB Disconnects
```bash
# Quick reconnect script
alias quick-reconnect='adb kill-server && adb start-server && adb devices'
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] All 3 MCP tools responding in Claude Desktop

## Final Notes

### Why This Works in 1 Day
1. **Photo-migration tool**: Already built and tested - just use it
2. **Mobile-mcp**: Forking existing working code - just extend it
3. **Shared-state**: Just wrapping your existing DuckDB as MCP
4. **Claude Agent**: Simple orchestration instructions
5. **Demo**: Pre-planned script minimizes recording time

### The Key Differentiators
- **Real device**: Not an emulator, actual Galaxy Z Fold 7
- **Real migration**: Your actual 18-year photo library
- **Real complexity**: Family of 5, cross-platform
- **Real AI orchestration**: Claude making decisions
- **Real-time**: Everything happening live

### Risk Mitigation
- Test each component individually first
- Have fallback options for each demo section
- Pre-stage some data if needed
- Record multiple takes if necessary
- Keep demo to 10 minutes max

This plan gets you from current state to recorded demo in one focused day. The key is leveraging what you've already built (photo-migration) and what exists (mobile-mcp), with minimal new code (just extensions and wrappers).
